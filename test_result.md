# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The error was caused by the auth state issue where isAuthenticated was undefined while hasToken was true, causing undefined property access during state updates. COMPREHENSIVE FIX: 1) Auth State Fix: Added isAuthenticated alias to AuthContext to ensure ChatProvider receives correct authentication state. 2) Defensive Coding: Enhanced sendText function with comprehensive error handling, input validation, and state checks. 3) Error Boundary: Added React Error Boundary component to catch and display JavaScript errors gracefully. 4) WebSocket Stability: Improved message processing with duplicate checking and robust error handling. VERIFICATION: Conducted extensive reproduction testing with message sending in sync mode - no 'editing' errors occurred. Error Boundary properly captures any runtime errors. Console logs show stable system: mode: sync, isAuthenticated: true, hasWebSocket: true, message sending working flawlessly. Real-time messaging confirmed working with 4-message conversation visible on both sender and receiver sides. Bug completely resolved with no regressions."

DETAILED VERIFICATION: Tested message sending via POST /api/chats/{chat_id}/messages with various content types (basic text, Unicode/emoji, special characters, long messages). All messages generated unique UUIDs, maintained consistent normalized structure, and persisted correctly. CONCLUSION: Backend message sending functionality is robust and working correctly.

TEST USERS: Used existing ssaritan@example.com and ssaritan2@example.com as requested. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR CONFIRMED: POST /api/chats/{chat_id}/messages returns normalized message with all required fields, WebSocket broadcast uses same normalized structure, backend handles undefined/null gracefully, all messages have guaranteed unique IDs.

##     -message: "✅ RATE LIMITING OPTIMIZATION TESTING COMPLETED: Executed comprehensive testing of the new rate limiting optimization for message sending as specifically requested in review. ALL 5 SPECIFIC TESTS PASSED: 1) Normal Message Sending - 5/5 messages sent successfully within rate limits (30 messages per minute working correctly), 2) Rapid Message Sending - Successfully triggered rate limiting by sending 35 messages rapidly, first 429 error occurred at message 26 (expected ~30), 3) 429 Error Response Verification - Confirmed proper HTTP 429 'Too Many Requests' response with correct error message 'Too many requests. Please slow down.', 4) Rate Limit Reset Testing - Rate limit properly reset after 60-second window, message sent successfully after wait period confirming window expiration works, 5) Real-time Messaging Compatibility - WebSocket broadcasting continues to work perfectly with rate limiting active, both users can send/receive in real-time. DETAILED RESULTS: Normal messages (5/5 success), Rapid messages (25/35 success, 10/35 rate limited), Rate limit triggered at message 26, Reset after 60 seconds working, Real-time messages (2/2 with WebSocket notifications). BACKEND LOGS CONFIRMED: Rate limiting logic working (🚫 Rate limit exceeded for user, 429 responses), WebSocket broadcasting unaffected. CONCLUSION: Rate limiting optimization is working correctly and provides protection against spam without breaking normal chat functionality. Frontend 1-second throttling combined with backend 30/minute rate limiting provides comprehensive protection against 429 errors."

B) Case Sensitivity Handling - Codes work regardless of case (lowercase '732e7d', mixed case 'e9fB0C' all work correctly), confirming case-insensitive matching. C) Edge Cases & Error Handling - Malformed codes ('', 'ABC', 'ABCDEFGH', 'AB CD', '!@#$%^') properly rejected, empty/whitespace codes rejected, duplicate joining handled gracefully (idempotent), joining own chat handled appropriately. D) Rate Limiting & Security - Multiple rapid join attempts (5 chats) handled without issues, authentication required for joining (endpoint protected).
