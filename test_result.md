# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

COMPREHENSIVE FIX: 1) Auth State Fix: Added isAuthenticated alias to AuthContext to ensure ChatProvider receives correct authentication state. 2) Defensive Coding: Enhanced sendText function with comprehensive error handling, input validation, and state checks. 3) Error Boundary: Added React Error Boundary component to catch and display JavaScript errors gracefully. 4) WebSocket Stability: Improved message processing with duplicate checking and robust error handling. VERIFICATION: Conducted extensive reproduction testing with message sending in sync mode - no 'editing' errors occurred. Error Boundary properly captures any runtime errors. Console logs show stable system: mode: sync, isAuthenticated: true, hasWebSocket: true, message sending working flawlessly. Real-time messaging confirmed working with 4-message conversation visible on both sender and receiver sides. Bug completely resolved with no regressions."

TESTING ENVIRONMENT: Mobile viewport (390x844 iPhone 12), offline mode authentication, ADHDers Social Club app. NAVIGATION SUCCESS: ✅ App loads correctly showing 'ADHDers Social Club' branding, ✅ Offline authentication working ('Continue (offline)' button functional), ✅ Chat interface accessible with existing messages visible, ✅ Mobile UI displays correctly with proper responsive design. CRITICAL FRONTEND ISSUES FOUND: ❌ VoiceRecorder component not rendering in chat composer - microphone button missing from message input area, ❌ Cannot test long press recording functionality due to component not appearing in DOM, ❌ Cannot test waveform animation, timer display, or swipe-to-cancel gesture, ❌ Cannot test VoicePlayer component as no voice messages can be created. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS: ✅ VoiceRecorder.tsx code exists with comprehensive WhatsApp-style features (long press, waveform, timer, swipe-cancel, haptic feedback), ✅ VoicePlayer.tsx code exists with animated waveform, play/pause, progress tracking, ✅ ChatContext voice integration code is production-ready, ✅ Chat interface integration code shows proper imports and handlers. CONSOLE ERRORS: 'Unexpected text node' errors in React Native View components suggest rendering issues. ROOT CAUSE: VoiceRecorder component integration has rendering problems - component not mounting in chat composer despite proper code implementation.

    -message: "🎙️ FINAL COMPREHENSIVE VOICE RECORDING TEST COMPLETED - CRITICAL INFINITE RENDER LOOP CONFIRMED: Executed definitive testing of WhatsApp-style voice recording feature implementation as requested in review. TESTING ENVIRONMENT: Mobile viewport (390x844 iPhone 12), direct chat access to /adhd_support, comprehensive console log monitoring. MAJOR PROGRESS ACHIEVED: ✅ VoiceRecorder component is now FULLY VISIBLE - yellow microphone button successfully renders in chat composer area alongside text input ('Type a message...') and blue send button. ✅ Chat interface loads correctly showing existing messages (Ava's welcome message, user's Pomodoro response) with proper mobile layout and WhatsApp-style message bubbles. ✅ Message composer is functional - text input field working with proper placeholder text. ✅ No red screen errors or complete crashes - app remains usable despite rendering issues. ❌ CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE CONFIRMED: Severe infinite render loop caused by React Native View errors: 'Unexpected text node: . A text node cannot be a child of a <View>' repeated hundreds of times in console logs. This prevents actual voice recording functionality testing as the interface becomes unresponsive due to continuous re-rendering. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: While VoiceRecorder component visibility and integration issues have been successfully resolved (primary objectives achieved), the infinite render loop makes the voice recording feature unusable in practice. Users can see the microphone button but cannot interact with it due to performance degradation from continuous re-rendering. CONCLUSION: The main agent's fixes have successfully resolved VoiceRecorder component rendering and integration, but the React Native View text node errors causing infinite render loop remain the final critical blocker preventing production-ready voice recording functionality."

    -message: "🎙️ COMPREHENSIVE FINAL VOICE RECORDING TEST COMPLETED - INTEGRATION SUCCESSFUL BUT CRITICAL ERRORS PERSIST: Executed comprehensive final testing of WhatsApp-style voice recording feature as requested in review. TESTING ENVIRONMENT: Mobile viewport (390x844 iPhone 12), offline authentication, direct URL navigation to chat detail. MAJOR SUCCESS: ✅ Chat Interface Stability - Successfully accessed chat detail view via direct navigation, loads correctly with 'No messages yet' state and proper mobile layout. ✅ VoiceRecorder Component Integration - Yellow microphone button successfully renders in chat composer area alongside text input ('Type a message...') and blue send button. Component properly imported and integrated with handleVoiceComplete/handleVoiceCancel functions. ✅ Mobile Experience - Chat interface displays correctly on iPhone 12 dimensions (390x844) with proper responsive design, back button, and chat header. ✅ Backend Integration Ready - ChatContext voice integration code is production-ready with proper base64 audio conversion and API integration. CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE: ❌ Infinite Render Loop - Severe React Native View errors causing infinite render loop: 'Unexpected text node: . A text node cannot be a child of a <View>' (repeated hundreds of times) and 'Maximum update depth exceeded'. Console shows repeated ChatProvider and ChatDetail render cycles preventing any user interaction. IMPACT: VoiceRecorder integration is complete and successful, but voice recording functionality cannot be tested due to infinite render loop blocking all user interactions. VoicePlayer component cannot be tested as voice messages cannot be created. CONCLUSION: Voice recording implementation is technically complete with proper component integration, but requires fixing React Native View text node errors to enable functionality testing."
