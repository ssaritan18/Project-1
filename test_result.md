# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The error was caused by the auth state issue where isAuthenticated was undefined while hasToken was true, causing undefined property access during state updates. COMPREHENSIVE FIX: 1) Auth State Fix: Added isAuthenticated alias to AuthContext to ensure ChatProvider receives correct authentication state. 2) Defensive Coding: Enhanced sendText function with comprehensive error handling, input validation, and state checks. 3) Error Boundary: Added React Error Boundary component to catch and display JavaScript errors gracefully. 4) WebSocket Stability: Improved message processing with duplicate checking and robust error handling. VERIFICATION: Conducted extensive reproduction testing with message sending in sync mode - no 'editing' errors occurred. Error Boundary properly captures any runtime errors. Console logs show stable system: mode: sync, isAuthenticated: true, hasWebSocket: true, message sending working flawlessly. Real-time messaging confirmed working with 4-message conversation visible on both sender and receiver sides. Bug completely resolved with no regressions."

TESTING RESULTS: App successfully loads, login works, Friends screen displays with proper debug information. The friends list shows 'Array.isArray=true, Length=0' when in local mode, confirming the rendering logic is working correctly. The issue was that app defaults to local mode - when user enables sync mode, the backend friends data should populate correctly since backend testing confirmed friends data is available."

TEST USERS: Used existing ssaritan@example.com and ssaritan2@example.com as requested. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR CONFIRMED: POST /api/chats/{chat_id}/messages returns normalized message with all required fields, WebSocket broadcast uses same normalized structure, backend handles undefined/null gracefully, all messages have guaranteed unique IDs.

##         -comment: "✅ COMPREHENSIVE WHATSAPP-STYLE MESSAGE PROCESSING TEST COMPLETED: Executed comprehensive testing of the new WhatsApp-style message processing backend system as per review request. ALL 6 KEY AREAS TESTED SUCCESSFULLY: 1) Unique ID Generation - All messages generate unique UUID identifiers (tested 5 messages, all unique), 2) Normalized Response Structure - Consistent message shape with all 11 required fields (id, _id, chat_id, author_id, author_name, text, type, status, reactions, created_at, server_timestamp), 3) Message Status Handling - All messages correctly marked as 'sent' status, 4) Validation & Error Handling - Empty/invalid messages properly rejected (4 validation scenarios working: empty text, null text, missing text field, whitespace-only text), 5) WebSocket Broadcasting - Normalized structure broadcast to other users in real-time with correct payload format, 6) Database Persistence - Messages saved to MongoDB with complete normalized structure. CONCLUSION: WhatsApp-style message processing backend is robust and working correctly. Prevents crashes with guaranteed unique IDs and consistent structure. Ready for frontend integration - eliminates undefined ID issues. Backend provides reliable message processing that matches WhatsApp-style expectations."
