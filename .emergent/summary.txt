The trajectory details the transition of the ADHDers Social Club app from an AI engineer to a new expert. Initially, the AI engineer addressed critical environment issues (ngrok, image picker) and overhauled the chat system with real-time features, unique IDs, and rate limiting. It also laid groundwork for Community, Profile, and Voice Recording. Post-handover, the user provided a multi-phase plan, prioritizing Profile UI improvements (Phase 1) and Home/Dashboard redesign (Phase 2), emphasizing ADHD-friendly, dopamine-triggering design. The AI successfully implemented both phases, creating new components for achievements, streaks, statistics, and a segmented progress bar, integrating them with backend APIs. Significant debugging was required to resolve persistent blank screen issues, which were traced to an  subdomain misconfiguration and later, a bug in the home page's Test Button functionality, both of which were successfully fixed. The app now features a robust Profile and Home screen.

<product_requirements>
The ADHDers Social Club is a mobile MVP for individuals with ADHD, focusing on task management, community, and motivation with a local-first, online-sync approach. It includes user authentication, a task dashboard, a community feed for posts (CRUD, reactions, comments, privacy), a profile screen (streaks, data tools), and a Friends System with real-time notifications. The app targets a modern, minimal, motivational UI with a pastel palette, emphasizing ADHD-friendly design principles like dopamine-triggering micro-interactions, celebration animations, and clear progress feedback.

**Implemented Features/Updates:**
*   **Chat System:** Real-time 1-to-1 messaging with unique IDs, normalized structures, status, reactions (emojis), and server-side rate limiting (30 msg/min) with client-side throttling.
*   **Authentication & UI/UX:** Remember Me, functional login on Web, Safe Area support, improved friends list and chat/community layouts.  endpoint added.
*   **Community Feed:** Backend supports Posts (CRUD), Reactions (4 types), Comments, and 3-level privacy. Frontend has interactive UI, post creation, and a web-compatible comment modal.
*   **Profile Management (Phase 1 Complete):** Backend supports profile updates, picture upload (base64), and settings. Frontend includes new screens (, ) and components for Achievements, Streak Visualization, Profile Statistics, and a gamified Profile Completion Guide, all designed with ADHD reward mechanisms in mind.
*   **Home/Dashboard Redesign (Phase 2 Complete):** Includes a segmented progression bar with You Are Here indicators, a Focus Mode Timer, time-based task organization, and motivational messages, with a toggle for different dashboard views.
*   **Voice Recording:** Backend supports upload/storage/broadcasting, frontend integration pending.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed Phase 1 (Profile UI Improvements) and Phase 2 (Home/Dashboard Redesign). For Phase 1, new components (, , , ) were created and integrated into , along with corresponding backend APIs in  for achievements, streaks, and statistics. For Phase 2,  and  components were developed and integrated into  to create an ADHD-friendly dashboard with time-based task organization and focus modes.

During implementation, the app repeatedly displayed a blank screen after changes. Initial debugging involved temporarily disabling animations in the new components. The root cause was identified as  in , which was corrected to resolve  tunnel conflicts, allowing the app to finally load to the login screen.

After the app loaded, the user reported a bug where the home page appeared empty and a Test Button was non-functional. The AI investigated , fixed the  functionality, and re-implemented the full ADHD dashboard with a toggle, making the home page fully functional and interactive. The app is now stable and fully displaying the enhanced Profile and Home screens with ADHD-friendly design principles applied.
