The AI engineer successfully guided the ADHDers Social Club application from an initial MVP through a major UI overhaul and into monetization. The project started with fundamental fixes and a homepage redesign. The core of the work involved a comprehensive UI transformation to a Glow - The App For Neurodivergents aesthetic, meticulously applied across all screens (Profile, Home, Chat, Community, Auth flows, etc.). Key challenges included integrating and then removing NativeWind due to build errors, and debugging persistent UI issues (e.g.,  syntax errors, subscription modal scroll issues, / dependency conflicts), which often required service restarts and temporary mock implementations.

The recent focus shifted heavily to monetization. This included implementing a Mood Tracker, a full Freemium model with a Subscription Page, an Onboarding Subscription Modal after assessment, a simulated Google Play/App Store payment system, subscription cancellation flow with real-time UI updates, and mock integrations for Banner, Rewarded, and Interstitial AdMob ads. The AI consistently addressed user feedback and bug reports, adapting the plan to ensure a robust and user-friendly experience before transitioning to real production integrations. The project is currently addressing a bug where new tasks cannot be created on the home page.

<product_requirements>
The ADHDers Social Club is a social platform designed with ADHD-friendly features. Initially, it focused on stabilizing core functionalities like profile editing, photo uploads, and a re-engineered ADHD-friendly dashboard. The primary recent request was a complete UI/UX overhaul to a Glow - The App For Neurodivergents aesthetic across all screens: Welcome, Authentication (Assessment, Sign Up, Login), Profile, Community, Chat, Friends, and Home.

Further user requests expanded the scope to include:
1.  **Mood / Emotion Tracker and Pattern Map:** A daily emoji-based mood tracker replacing Quick Actions on the homepage, with pattern analysis integrated into the Profile Statistics.
2.  **Freemium Model Structure:**
    *   **Free Tier (with ads):** Basic task management, 3 focus sessions/day, read-only community, max 5 friends, banner ads.
    *   **Premium Tier (.99/month):** Ad-free, unlimited focus sessions, full community, advanced analytics, unlimited friends, premium themes, priority support.
3.  **Subscription Page:** A dedicated screen to display the pricing tiers with a Glow-themed UI.
4.  **Onboarding Subscription Modal:** A pop-up after the ADHD assessment results, offering users the choice between Free and Premium plans.
5.  **Real Payment Integration:** Implement Google Play/App Store in-app purchase for premium subscriptions, moving beyond mock payments.
6.  **Downgrade/Cancellation Flow:** Implement a cancellation modal for premium users, immediately reverting to the free tier upon confirmation, with an expiry message for the current billing period.
7.  **AdMob Integration:** Integrate banner ads for free users (Home, Community pages) and interstitial ads (after task completion, upon reaching focus session limits).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on debugging and fixing a critical bug reported by the user: the create new task button on the home page () was not working. The user reported that clicking the button did not allow them to add a new task, indicating a functional issue with the task creation form.

The AI engineer has identified the problem: the  function in  is likely not closing the task creation modal after a task is submitted or attempted to be submitted. This prevents the user from interacting with the UI further to create a new task. The current state is that the AI has successfully identified the problematic area in the code ( function and modal closure logic) and is in the process of implementing a fix.
