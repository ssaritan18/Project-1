The trajectory outlines a complex, iterative debugging and feature implementation journey for an ADHDers social club application. The AI engineer, taking over from an initial build, primarily focused on stabilizing authentication, token persistence, and real-time chat/friend request functionalities. Initial work involved basic environment variable fixes and API routing. A major challenge was the persistent frontend instability, manifesting as  errors,  issues, and package version mismatches, frequently necessitating  interventions and static builds. Crucially, the token management system evolved from simple  to a robust, cross-platform  solution. The real-time friend and chat features, initially plagued by  errors (due to missing database data and incorrect API paths) and later / errors (due to API call loops and WebSocket token issues), eventually settled on a polling fallback due to persistent WebSocket routing problems in the preview environment. The session concludes with the user taking over for manual troubleshooting, indicating unresolved, complex issues primarily around WebSocket and persistent API authorization.

<product_requirements>
The user is developing an ADHDers social club application, requiring robust authentication, real-time friend requests, chat, and media upload features. The core problem was a non-functional media upload due to .

Key requirements included:
1.  **Stable Backend/Frontend Communication**: Correct API prefixing () and environment variable usage (, , ).
2.  **Authentication and Token Management**: Persist JWT tokens () securely ( then ), inject  into all API calls, and redirect unauthenticated users to login.
3.  **Real-Time Friend/Chat Flow**: Implement Twitter/Instagram-like friend requests (send, receive, accept/decline with real-time updates via WebSockets) and direct messaging with media upload. Messages, emojis, and media should render correctly.
4.  **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure token storage and features work on both web and native (Expo).
5.  **Robustness**: Implement WebSocket reconnection logic and a polling fallback for unreliable environments.
6.  **Functional Frontend**: Resolve issues like frontend not loading, directory listings, and general instability.

The overarching goal is a production-ready application with reliable real-time social features.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React/Expo frontend.



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Purpose**: Defines FastAPI endpoints, authentication, and WebSocket handling.
    -   **Changes**: Ensured  prefix, configured . Implemented WebSocket endpoint ( then attempted ), added  endpoint. Modified friend request and message endpoints to integrate with the real-time event system. JWT validation logic was examined.
-   :
    -   **Purpose**: Centralized, robust utility for getting, setting, and clearing auth tokens across platforms.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored to use  for native and / for web. Implemented logic to strip extra quotes from tokens. Used  for web platform detection.
-   :
    -   **Purpose**: Manages global authentication state.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated  for all token operations (login, logout, initialization). Corrected login function calls and refined error handling for  on Axios errors during registration.
-   :
    -   **Purpose**: Manages friends list and requests.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed an infinite API call loop by adjusting  dependencies for the  function. Integrated real-time event listeners for  and . Updated  and  to use new backend API formats.
-   :
    -   **Purpose**: Manages runtime configurations, WebSocket connection, and polling fallback.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored WebSocket connection logic to use  for token retrieval and ensure correct URL encoding. Implemented a robust polling fallback mechanism for preview environments. Added event listeners to dispatch incoming WebSocket messages to other contexts.
-   :
    -   **Purpose**: Encapsulates chat-related API calls.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  and  to use  for token retrieval.
-   :
    -   **Purpose**: Manages frontend dependencies.
    -   **Changes**: Added  as a dependency. Various package version updates were attempted to resolve build issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   **WebSocket Direct Connection**: The direct WebSocket connection () still consistently fails with 404/401 errors, primarily in the preview environment, likely due to NGINX/Kubernetes ingress configuration issues. The current solution relies on polling as a fallback.
-   **Comprehensive Frontend Feature Testing**: While individual components (login, token storage) have been tested, a full end-to-end user flow verification by the user (e.g., friend request send/receive, chat messages, media upload rendering) after all recent fixes is needed.
-   **Backend Error Handling**: Improve JWT validation error handling in the backend to return 401/403 instead of 500.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving persistent issues with the real-time system, specifically focusing on the WebSocket connection and API authentication. The  was fully refactored to use  for native platforms and  for web, and integrated across , , and API calls to ensure robust token management.

Despite these efforts, the WebSocket connection continued to fail (404/401 errors, token double-encoding), particularly in the preview environment, indicating an underlying routing or configuration issue beyond code logic. The  endpoint was also added to the backend to support the polling fallback, but frontend build errors related to  hindered its full integration and testing.

The last major effort involved streamlining WebSocket connection logic in , integrating the  asynchronously, and enhancing the polling fallback. The backend real-time event system for friend requests was implemented. However, the Frontend testing agent still reported that the  endpoint returned 404, and there were issues with frontend static builds and client-side routing.

The AI engineer made several attempts to fix WebSocket URL pathing and encoding, and debugged build failures. Ultimately, the polling system was made more robust to compensate for the WebSocket issues in the preview environment. The user then requested a GitHub push to perform manual troubleshooting of the remaining complex issues, specifically around WebSocket 401s, Friends API 401s, and token mismatches.
