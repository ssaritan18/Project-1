The AI engineer successfully transitioned the application from an initial MVP state to a more robust, feature-rich platform. The journey was marked by persistent debugging, particularly around the community comment system, where frontend-backend URL mismatches, authentication issues, and rendering problems (including a critical format mismatch and a  system error workaround) were systematically addressed. A pivotal moment was the decision, initiated by the user, to completely redesign the community feed to a Twitter-like model, which rapidly resolved many lingering UI/UX issues. Following this, the AI engineer incrementally implemented new features: profile picture integration, a comprehensive search and hashtag system with trending topics, and a full-fledged notification system (in-app, toast, and push). The work concluded mid-implementation of backend integration for the new community features, specifically adding styling for a production toggle.

The ADHDers Social Club aims to be a social platform for neurodivergents, featuring a Glow UI/UX. Initial features included a mood tracker, freemium model, subscription management (page, modal, in-app purchases, cancellation), and AdMob integration.

Recent explicit requests during this trajectory evolved significantly:
1.  **Initial Problem:** Fix a broken community comment system (backend connection, authentication, UI rendering, text node errors).
2.  **AdMob:** Integrate AdMob test ads.
3.  **Twitter-style Community Feed:** Redesign the community section to be a simple, Twitter-like feed with post creation, liking, replying, and sharing. This was a critical pivot to resolve persistent comment rendering issues.
4.  **Delete Functionality:** Allow users to delete their own posts via a 3-dots menu with confirmation.
5.  **Profile Pictures:** Display user profile images (synced from the Profile tab) next to posts and in the reply modal, with initials as a fallback.
6.  **Search & Hashtags:** Implement a search bar for text and hashtags, clickable hashtags within posts, and a trending hashtags bar per category.
7.  **Notifications:** Develop a comprehensive notification system including in-app bell with unread count, toast pop-ups for immediate feedback, and push notifications.
8.  **Backend Integration:** Connect the new community features to a MongoDB backend for data persistence, with a toggle for production mode (test posts not saved).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on **Backend Integration (Feature 4)** for the new Twitter-style community feed. The backend API endpoints for creating, getting, liking, replying, and sharing posts have been defined and tested to be functional in .

On the frontend side, in :
-   A new  state variable and a toggle button in the header were introduced to switch between local state (test mode) and backend persistence (production mode).
-   Functions like  and the modified  were implemented to interact with the backend when  is true.
-   A loading indicator was added to provide user feedback during backend operations.
-   The current task was to finalize the styling for the new production toggle and associated header actions. The most recent action was to add these missing styles. The file  was being updated to include new style definitions for the  and  within its StyleSheet.
