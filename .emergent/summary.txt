The AI engineer's work on the ADHDers Social Club app commenced with resolving critical environment and frontend connectivity issues, specifically  tunnel conflicts and  dependency problems, which prevented the app from loading or functioning. A major effort was dedicated to overhauling the real-time chat system, addressing  crashes due to undefined message IDs and implementing a robust WhatsApp-style messaging architecture with unique UUIDs, normalized message structures, and server-side rate limiting alongside client-side throttling. The development then shifted to building out infrastructure for Community Feed (CRUD, reactions, comments), Profile Management (update, picture upload, settings), and Voice Recording. Most recently, the AI fixed a web-incompatible  for comments and ensured chat reactions properly increment, resolving critical UI bugs and solidifying the MVP before an autonomous feature implementation phase.

The ADHDers Social Club is an MVP mobile application designed for individuals with ADHD, focusing on task management and a supportive community. It emphasizes local-first functionality with online sync. Core features include user authentication (login/signup), a main dashboard for daily tasks, a community screen for posts, a profile screen with streaks and data tools, and a robust Friends System (search, requests, real-time notifications via WebSockets). The app aims for a modern, minimal, motivational UI with a pastel palette.

**Implemented Features/Updates:**
*   **Chat System:** Fully real-time 1-to-1 messaging with scrollable lists, input, Safe Area support, and auto-scrolling. Uses REST for CRUD and WebSockets for real-time. Messages now have unique IDs, normalized structures, and status management. Backend has rate limiting (30 msg/min), and frontend has throttling (1s delay). Chat reactions (emojis) are functional and real-time.
*   **Login Flow:** Remember Me and functional login button on Expo Web. Authentication token/sync issues resolved,  context fixed.
*   **UI/UX Improvements:** Comprehensive Safe Area support, improved friends list, corrected chat/community layouts.
*   **Authentication:** Missing  endpoint added.
*   **Community Feed:** Backend fully supports Posts (CRUD), Reactions (4 types), Comments, and 3-level privacy filtering (private, friends, public). Frontend has interactive feed UI, post creation modal, and web-compatible comment modal.
*   **Profile Management:** Backend supports profile updates, picture upload (base64), and settings management. Frontend has Edit Profile and Settings screens, including image picker.
*   **Voice Recording:** Backend supports voice message upload, storage, and real-time broadcasting, though frontend integration is paused.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a phase of High Priority Polishing based on user feedback. The core issues addressed were:

1.  **Chat Reactions Bug Fix**: The problem was identified as a missing message reaction endpoint in the backend and an inconsistent response format from the WebSocket handler. The AI implemented the  endpoint in  and updated the WebSocket message handler in  to correctly process reaction updates in real-time.
2.  **Community Comments System**: The user reported an uncaught error when clicking comments. The AI diagnosed this as  being incompatible with Expo Web. A new web-compatible  component was created in . The  was updated to use this modal for comments, and the  was enhanced with an  function.  was updated to include a comment button and pass the  handler.
3.  **Profile Picture Upload**: This feature was mostly complete but caused a server error for the user. The AI identified that  was a missing dependency. It was installed via 
added 656 packages in 26s

60 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details. The  component, previously created in , was fully integrated into  to handle image selection (gallery/camera) and base64 upload to the backend.

All these high-priority items were successfully fixed and implemented, ensuring the core MVP (Chat, Community, Profile, Auth, Friends) is functional and stable, ready for further polishing. The user confirmed the successful resolution of the server error and was about to save the current state to GitHub.
