This trajectory chronicles an extensive debugging and feature development journey for an Expo mobile application, primarily focusing on the ADHDers Social Club chat system. Initially, the AI engineer addressed  tunnel connectivity and UI rendering issues for the friends list. Subsequently, the main task shifted to developing and integrating a real-time chat system. The process involved multiple iterations of backend API and WebSocket development, frontend UI enhancements (including safe area support), and persistent debugging of caching, rendering, authentication, and WebSocket stability. Key issues included  misconfigurations,  not rendering, hardcoded URLs in a forked environment, and React state management problems leading to messages not displaying. The AI systematically troubleshot and fixed these, culminating in a stable backend and frontend for direct 1-to-1 chats, with a final focus on resolving fundamental architectural issues preventing the chat system from fully functioning.

<product_requirements>
The ADHDers Social Club is an MVP mobile app designed for individuals with ADHD, offering task management and a supportive community. It emphasizes local-first functionality with online sync. Key features include onboarding (offline/online login), a main dashboard for daily tasks, a community screen with user interactions, a profile screen with streaks and data tools, and a robust Friends System for searching, sending/accepting requests, and real-time notifications via WebSockets. The app aims for a modern, minimal, motivational UI with a pastel palette.

**Implemented Features/Updates:**
*   **Chat System:** Initially a local-only MVP, it was extensively developed to support real-time 1-to-1 messaging.
    *   **UI:** Scrollable message lists with bubbles, bottom input field, send button, SafeAreaView support, auto-scroll to latest message.
    *   **Backend:** REST API endpoints ( for sending/retrieving), WebSocket for real-time message broadcasting and reactions.
    *   **Logic:** Messages persist in MongoDB. Real-time updates via WebSockets, replacing initial polling requirement.
    *   **Direct Chat:** When two users become friends, a unique 1-to-1 chat is automatically created. A Message button appears next to each friend in the Friends tab, leading directly to their chat. Invitation codes are now only for group chats.
*   **Login Flow:** Email/user reminder feature (Remember Me) added to login screen.
*   **UI/UX Improvements:**
    *   Comprehensive Safe Area support implemented across all main screens (Dashboard, Friends, Chat List/Detail, Profile, Community).
    *   Friends list debug panel improved for scrollability and detailed info.
    *   Chat header UI fixed for proper display and navigation.
    *   Community tab layout improved with safe area support and title/subtitle.
*   **Authentication Robustness:** Email verification temporarily bypassed/manual verification for development purposes. Login token/sync issues resolved.

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on resolving critical, fundamental architectural issues that prevent the chat system from fully functioning. Despite extensive debugging, including fixing  tunnel issues, UI rendering problems, Safe Area inconsistencies, and initial WebSocket integration, the real-time messaging was still not working as expected.

The AI engineer identified that the  was not correctly transitioning to sync mode due to a missing  property in its context, leading to all chat operations staying local. Additionally, hardcoded URLs specific to a previous preview environment were causing connectivity issues between the frontend and backend in the current forked environment.

Currently, the AI engineer is undertaking a system engineer mode approach to:
1.  Completely fix the provider hierarchy, ensuring all contexts (Auth, RuntimeConfig, Chat) are correctly wrapped and receive necessary props.
2.  Debug and correct all API routing issues, specifically the hardcoded URLs preventing proper frontend-backend communication.
3.  Resolve the  rendering issues that prevent its debug logs from appearing, indicating it's not initializing correctly.

The AI has just completed fixing hardcoded URLs in both the frontend's  and the backend's  to ensure communication points to  for the backend. Services have been restarted, and a basic API connectivity test was successful. The next step is to make 's debug logs reliably active by further refining the runtime configuration.

<optional_next_step>
The AI engineer will create a comprehensive end-to-end test to verify the complete chat flow after the architectural fixes.
