The AI engineer successfully navigated a complex development trajectory, starting with critical Metro bundler build failures. Initial efforts involved repetitive debugging, cache clearing, and simplifying problematic template literals in  and , eventually resolving the build issues and creating a . Following this, the AI completely re-engineered the homepage based on user feedback, integrating all core features into a single, ADHD-friendly dashboard.

Subsequent tasks focused on bug fixes and feature refinements: removing the voice recorder, fixing profile photo upload/persistence, making chat media upload web-compatible, implementing functional ADHD Focus Mode timers, and correcting task progression. The most challenging bug was persistent profile photo save/persistence, which required extensive debugging, leading to the discovery and fix of a localStorage key mismatch. Finally, the AI implemented profile data synchronization between the edit and main profile screens. The work concludes with a stable, functional application, ready for UI Kit integration and ad monetization.

The ADHDers Social Club application aimed to provide a social platform with ADHD-friendly features. Initially, the primary goal was to stabilize existing functionality and complete partially implemented features. This included robust profile editing (save/load all fields, authentication), profile photo upload (camera/gallery, backend integration), theme preferences (fix dark/light, remove language), chat media upload, and a functional voice recorder. The homepage needed cleanup, removing test buttons.

During development, the user redefined the homepage, requesting a single-page dashboard experience that integrates all features directly (Add New Task, Progression Bars, Neurodivergency Hub, Focus Mode, Stats) without requiring navigation. Subsequent requests focused on bug fixes for photo upload persistence and sync, ensuring Focus Mode buttons redirect to timers, and fixing task progression. The long-term vision includes integrating a UI Kit, Google AdMob for a freemium model (banner/video ads, subscriptions), and preparing for deployment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully resolved the critical and persistent bug of profile photo and data persistence. The issue was traced back to a mismatch in the  keys used for saving and loading profile data ( for saving,  for initial loading).

The AI fixed this by:
1.  Ensuring  in  correctly saves the  object using .
2.  Modifying  in  to retrieve data using , thus resolving the key mismatch.
3.  Implementing  state and  in  to ensure that the main profile screen automatically loads and displays the persisted profile image and name from  whenever the screen is focused.

The application is now stable, with all core features (Metro bundler, profile photo upload/save/sync, ADHD Focus Mode Timers, task management, removed voice recorder, web-compatible file pickers) working. The user confirmed the successful persistence and sync of profile data, including the photo.
