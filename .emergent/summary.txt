This trajectory details the debugging and resolution of critical issues in the ADHDers Social Club mobile application. The primary task was to fix a persistent UI rendering bug for the friends list on mobile, which was initially suspected to be a  issue. It was later discovered to be a combination of the app launching in local mode instead of sync mode and extensive  tunnel connectivity problems preventing mobile access.

The AI engineer systematically addressed these by:
1.  Debugging frontend code, enhancing  with a manual rendering loop and detailed debug information.
2.  Resolving multiple  tunnel conflicts and endpoint offline errors by modifying supervisor configurations, updating  in , and cleaning up conflicting Expo processes using the .
3.  Utilizing comprehensive testing with a UI automation tool for login and navigation, and backend testing to confirm data integrity.
4.  Ultimately, the friends list rendering was fixed, and mobile access was confirmed working via the mobile browser, bypassing persistent Expo Go-specific  issues. The next task, CHAT feature development, was identified.

<product_requirements>
The ADHDers Social Club is an MVP mobile app for individuals with ADHD, offering task management and a supportive community. It features local-first functionality with online sync. Core features include onboarding (offline/online login), a main dashboard with daily tasks, a community screen with mock users, a profile screen with streaks and data tools, local-only chats/groups MVP, and a Friends System. The Friends System is critical, allowing search, sending requests, displaying incoming requests, and real-time notifications via WebSockets. The app targets a modern, minimal, motivational UI with a pastel palette, using Expo React Native frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB for online features, and AsyncStorage for local persistence.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully wire Posts and Chats to the backend (REST endpoints, then WebSockets for chat).
- Harden backend APIs (rate limiting, input validation, error shapes, pagination).
- Implement more advanced chat features like typing indicators and message reactions.
- Complete real email delivery for Forgot PIN/Email Verification.

<current_work>
The immediate work focused on resolving a persistent UI rendering bug for the friends list on mobile and persistent  tunnel connectivity issues. The frontend  now uses a manual rendering loop with a detailed debug panel displaying array type, length, and raw data, allowing for precise data inspection on screen. This debug panel was instrumental in discovering that the app was defaulting to local mode, leading to an empty friends list despite correct backend data.

Simultaneously, significant effort was put into resolving endpoint offline errors and  tunnel conflicts when accessing the app on mobile. This involved modifying supervisor configurations to manage the  flag for [16:42:03] Starting project at /app, identifying and killing conflicting Expo processes, and dynamically updating the  in .

Currently, the friends list rendering on mobile (via mobile browser) is fully functional, displays friends data correctly in online mode, and all  tunnel issues have been resolved to allow mobile access. The application can successfully log in, switch to online sync mode, and display the friends list with debug information.
