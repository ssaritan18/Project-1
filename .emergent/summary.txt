Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed a phase focused on achieving **UI consistency across the entire application**. This involved identifying and updating several secondary navigation pages that had retained the old UI design to match the new Glow - The App For Neurodivergents aesthetic.

The specific pages updated were:
1.  **Edit Profile Page ():** Transformed with gradient themes, colorful headers, section-based cards, and enhanced input fields.
2.  **Settings Page ():** Given a complete Glow theme transformation with gradient headers, section cards, enhanced toggles, and gradient checkmarks.
3.  **Help Page ():** Converted from a basic Turkish page to a modern Glow-themed guide with section-based cards, improved typography, and a gradient CTA button, with content translated to English.
4.  **Focus Timer Page ():** Updated with the Glow aesthetic, mode-specific gradients, enhanced circular progress displays, and improved control buttons.

After these UI updates, comprehensive screenshot tests were performed, and all navigation flows and visual consistency were verified as working perfectly. The user explicitly confirmed satisfaction with the UI updates.

The very last interaction involved the user inquiring about the application's storage size. The AI engineer provided a detailed breakdown, estimating the production mobile app bundle size to be around 20-30MB, confirming it to be lightweight.

The application is now considered feature-complete in terms of bug fixes, content enhancement, and UI consistency, and is deemed production-ready by the AI engineer, awaiting the final monetization integrations and deployment.
